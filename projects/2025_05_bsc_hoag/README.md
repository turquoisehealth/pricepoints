Side note: Neither BS of CA or Hoag are customers
What we want to do is look at the orange country payer / provider market and contextualize these on-going negotiations to help inform the conversation. Some obvious questions to explore:

- Are Hoagâ€™s payments from BC of CA in line with the market?
- How does Hoag compare to the local market?
- How does BC of CA compare to the local market?
- Any other interesting trends or contextualization of the local market?

## Notes

- Includes CMS shoppable services
- Triple check with the data team that the rates we pull are correct
- Maybe start with hospital rates
- Check for carveouts

## Competitors

- UCI Medical Center
- St Jude & St Joseph (providence)
- Memorial Care

## Todo

- Dig into specific comparable hospitals to Hoag in Orange county
- Look for a trend over time in BSC v Hoag rates. Try RC 272 (NICU per diem)
- Look for unsustainable trend in rates
- "I think you need ready access to hospital charge relativities (sometimes the out of the box index is the Cost to Charge Ratio CCR in the medicare cost report). That way you can keep an eye on when % of charge rates combined with list prices are out of whack. Chansoo and Stefano know more about this"
- Directly compare BSC to Anthem within Hoag
